This text pertains to the *utilia* project ("the Project"), which creates and
maintains the *utilia* software ("the Software") and the documentation and
other works which are distributed with it.

Copyrights
----------

All contributions to the Project are subject to the relevant licenses;
please read the licensing details below.

As of this writing, no assignment of copyrights is required for the acceptance
of contributions to the Software or other works which are distributed with it.

Attribution of Authorship
-------------------------

Version control systems provide a means of tracking the authorship of
contributions to a software distribution. Because of this and the copyright law
extant in most jurisdictions throughout the world, the Project forbids
copyright notices in anything contributed to it, with an exception being made 
for those contributions which originate from separate, published collections 
or distributions. Instead:

* the official version control repository for the Software and the other 
  works distributed with it shall serve as the official registry for tracking 
  the authorship of contributions;

* the Software shall be distributed with a file, named :file:`CONTRIB.txt`, 
  which shall be the official list of all contributors who wish to be 
  acknowledged as such.

The location of the official version control repository for the Software and
the other works distributed with it can be found at the following Internet URL:

   http://github.com/utilia/utilia

For a more detailed legal discussion behind this practice, please read the
following white paper from the Software Freedom Law Center:
   
   http://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2012/ManagingCopyrightInformation.html

For anything, which is not in the public domain and which is contributed to 
the Project from a separate, published collection or distribution, a notice 
about authorship and licensing shall appear in a file, named 
:file:`NOTICE.txt`, which shall be distributed with the Software.

License for the Software
------------------------

The Software is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0 (the
"Software License"). The text of the Software License may be found in the 
:file:`licenses` subdirectory of the :file:`doc` directory,

The contents of any file, distributed under the :file:`src` directory, 
excluding files named with a ``.dat`` suffix, are licensed under the Software

and named with a ``.dat`` suffix, is in the public domain. Portions of the
Software, which reside outside of the :file:`src` directory hierarchy, are also
licensed under the Software License. For example, scripts or source code
fragments, residing in a database table, are considered part of the Software,
even though the database, containing the table, may be distributed outside of
the :file:`src` directory hierarchy.

Exemptions to any of the foregoing are noted in the :file:`NOTICE.txt` file,
which is distributed with the Software.
