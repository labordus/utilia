*utilia*
========

Introduction
------------

**Welcome!**

*utilia* is a collection of Python scripts and a Python package, containing a
number of modules. The scripts and modules are useful in a wide variety of
circumstances.

The word *utilia* is Latin for *useful things*. (For those who care, it can be
used as either an adjective or a noun in Latin. The noun is a neuter 
nominative or accusative plural from the third declension. You might note that
it is shorter to say or type than *rebus utilibus*....).

The modules provide:

    * Awareness of the standard filesystem layouts of various operating 
      systems; reporting of standard paths to configuration information, 
      application data stores, temporary spaces, etc....
