Modules Library
---------------

All of the modules in the library, provided by this project, are contained in 
the :py:mod:`utilia` package. The modules have a wide variety of purposes, but
are united by a common theme, which has the following features:

   * Compatibility across multiple implementations and versions of Python.
     This compatibility is maintained **without** the use of automatic code 
     translators, such as :file:`2to3`. Presently, compatibility with the
     following implementations and versions of Python is maintained:

     * CPython (http://www.python.org), versions 2.6 and 2.7 and all versions
       from the 3.x series

   * Well-documented programming interfaces, including examples.

   * Useful, general purpose functionality, not provided by the Python standard
     library or available as robust, stand-alone implementations by third
     parties.

   * Seamless interoperability amongst components, when such interoperability
     is desirable and meaningful.

Scripts Collection
------------------

The collected scripts serve a wide variety of purposes, but have the following
features in common:

   * Written in Python with the same compatibility level as the 
     accompanying modules library.

   * Flexible execution in an OS-independent manner.

   * Well-documented invocation arguments and options, operations, and exit
     codes. Usage examples are also included in the documentation.

   * Useful, general purpose functionality.

   * Seamless interoperability amongst scripts, when such interoperability is
     desirable and meaningful.
