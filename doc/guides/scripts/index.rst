Scripts Collection
==================

Overview
--------

The collected scripts serve a wide variety of purposes, but have the following
features in common:

   * Written in Python with the same compatibility level as the 
     accompanying modules library.

   * Flexible execution in an OS-independent manner.

   * Well-documented invocation arguments and options, operations, and exit
     codes. Usage examples are also included in the documentation.

   * Useful, general purpose functionality.

   * Seamless interoperability amongst scripts, when such interoperability is
     desirable and meaningful.
